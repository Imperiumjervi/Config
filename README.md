## Description
This Neovim's config is powered by LazyVim, i did this with good plugins 
and i made some commands to work with basicly cpp projects, but you can 
make your own commands.

## Things to know:
The master in this case is space to do keymaps 
To open the nvimtree just do <Crtl> + n 
To open the telescope just do <Crtl> + t


So, this config has good plugins, which are:
1. LazyVim (powered by itself)
2. autocompletion
3. Copilot
4. Colorscheme
5. Dashboard 
6. Basic formatting 
7. Lsp (actually only work with java, javascript, python, c, cpp and lua)
8. Navigation with nvimtree and telescope
9. Statusline
10. Syntax
11. Float terminal
12. Which key
13. Indent 
14. Autopairs
15. Plugins to work with githu
16. Mason (To install your oww lsp servers)
