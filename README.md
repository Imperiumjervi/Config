## Description
This Neovim config is powered by LazyVim, and Iâ€™ve curated a set of excellent plugins to enhance the development experience. 
Some custom commands are set up to work with C++ projects, but you can easily create your own commands.

## Features:
The master in this case is space to do keymaps 
To open the nvimtree just do <Crtl> + n 
To open the telescope just do <Crtl> + t


So, this config has good plugins, some of them are:
1. LazyVim (powered by itself)
2. autocompletion
3. Copilot (Github Copilot integration)
4. Colorscheme (Dracula theme)
5. Dashboard (custom startup screen)
6. Basic formatting 
7. Lsp (actually only work with java, javascript, python, c, cpp and lua)
8. Navigation with nvimtree and telescope
9. Statusline (lualine)
10. Syntax Highlighting (nvim-treesitter)
11. Floating terminal (toggleterm)
12. Which key (to see the keymaps)
13. Indentation guides (indent-blankline)
14. Autopairs (Automatic closing of brackets and quotes)
15. Plugins to work with Github (gitsigns, vim_fugitive)
16. Mason (To install your oww lsp servers)
